### <font color=#ff8000>[Moe](https://github.com/0xDrMoe) - Founder / Operations Manager</font>

I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in High School, and I've been coding for 6 years. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French and Arabic verbally! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship, but I stumbled upon TOHE and I loved it. I decided to help out with the mod, and somehow I'm currently the President.

I specialize in HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python and C++. I graduated from College with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, focusing on Cybersecurity. and I'm working towards that goal.

### <font color=#49e6ac>[Pyro](https://www.youtube.com/notpyro404) - Website Maintainer + Retired Moderator</font>

I'm also mostly known online as NotPyro404. I was previously a Moderator in TEN's Discord Server, as well as the Website Maintainer for [T.E.N.](https://weareten.ca/) (Mainly TOHE Documentation). I've "coded" a bit for Town of Host: Enhanced, but not a lot.<br>
I'm a terrible Content Creator & Minecraft Builder.<br>
Unfortunately, Among Us just isn't a big interest of mine anymore, which as a result made my love towards TOHE, and mods in general, die down. I figured I owed you one last update though!
