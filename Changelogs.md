* By [**Pyro**](www.youtube.com/@NotPyro404)<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: [Guide to TOHE!](/Guide.html)<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Installation (FAQ) + Customization (Resources) are now covered in the brand new Guide to TOHE!<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: [Presets](/usc/Presets.html) and [Translations](/usc/Translations.html) have moved from Resources to their own [User Submitted Content](/USC.html) category (USC)<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: [Troubleshooting](/Troubleshooting.html) Page (Separated from FAQ)<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Overhauled [Mod Settings](/options/Settings/Mod.html) (Gamemodes are now dropdown menus + their settings, rather than a big text mess.)<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: Secondary Roles/Hidden Roles are now under Secondary folders. Secondary is for roles that only appear if one role is enabled. (You can't see Famine without Baker, or Evil Mini without Mini) Hidden Roles technically fall under that ruling. (You can't see Bard without Arrogance, or Requiter without Knight)<br>
\+ <font color=green><b>NEW</b></font>: SO MUCH MORE that I can't remember because it's like 2 in the morning!<br>
= <font color=#ece218><b>NOTICE</b></font>: If there are any other issues, or you simply have feedback, open a forum in `#website-feedback`! Thank you!<br>
