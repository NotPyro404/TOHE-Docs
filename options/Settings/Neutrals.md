# <font color="#7f8c8d"><b>Neutral Roles</b></font>

### Use the Sidebar to navigate roles!

Neutrals are out for themselves. Play for yourself, and eliminate everyone around you. Neutrals can win alone, but they can also win with other players. Their victory conditions are different from other players. Each Neutral player has a unique victory condition.<br>
<b>Total Role Count: 73</b>

## <font color=#cc0044><b>Apocalypse</b></font>
Apocalypse Neutral Roles are roles that have objectives that they must complete in order to transform. Upon transforming, they are immortal (besides getting voted out), and reveal that they are in the game (Not who it is though). These are like the Apocalypse roles from Town of Salem 2.<br>
<b>Role Count: 4</b>

## <font color=#046300><b>Benign</b></font>
Benign Neutral Roles win alongside whoever wins, usually as long as are alive at the end of the game, doesn't matter with who. Some Benign roles could be considered a Killing/Evil Neutral, but don't have their own win condition. Some Benign Roles can become a Killing Neutral role, but they are benign because they don't start that way.<br>
<b>Role Count: 16</b>

## <font color=#d4af37><b>Chaos</b></font>
Chaos Neutral Roles are similar to Evil Neutrals, however they are usually harder to figure out and get out of the game, as well as usually more confusing to play against/as.<br>
<b>Role Count: 10</b>

## <font color=#912900><b>Evil</b></font>
Evil Neutral Roles are roles that win on their own, but cannot directly kill using a kill button.<br>
<b>Role Count: 8</b>

## <font color=#4d3222><b>Experimental</b></font>
Experimental Neutral Roles are roles that need to be tested! These roles can be overpowered, underpowered, or game-breaking.<br>
<b>Role Count: 5</b>

## <font color=#b22222><b>Killing</b></font>
Killing Neutral Roles are roles that are considered a Killing Neutral, yeah it can get confusing but these roles are usually able to directly kill, delayed or not, and win on their own.<br>
<b>Role Count: 23</b>

## <font color=#7f8c8d><b>Secondary</b></font>
Secondary Neutral Roles are roles that require another role to be activated/used to appear. Such as a Secret role, (Sunnyboy is a Secret role of Jester) or a transformation of sorts (Pestilence is the second form of Plaguebearer.)<br>
