# <font color="#ff9ace"><b>Add-ons</b></font>

### Use the Sidebar to navigate roles!

These are modifiers that any players can acquire. There are some that help you, some that harm you, and some can do both! There are also some Impostor Only add-ons. Each one is unique in the way it affects the player.<br>
Some add-ons are only received from other players, such as Cleansed or Knighted. These are known as Betrayal Add-ons. These will not be covered on this page.<br>
