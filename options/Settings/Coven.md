### Use the Sidebar to navigate roles!

The Coven</font> is a faction of evildoers who specialize in witchcraft. Their goal is to kill all who would oppose the Coven. They use the Necronomicon to enhance their powers, but only one member at a time can hold it. A random Coven member will spawn with the Necronomicon, denoted by the <font color="#ac42f2">♣</font> symbol next to their name. Coven members can vote each other during meetings to determine who to pass the Necronomicon to.<br>
