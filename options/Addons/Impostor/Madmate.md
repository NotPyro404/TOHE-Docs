Only Crewmates can become Madmate. Madmate's task is to help the Impostors win the game. Madmate will lose if all Impostors are killed/ejected. Madmates may know who are Impostors, and Impostors may know who are Madmates (Host settings).<br>
Lazy Guy, Celebrity can't become Madmate. Sheriff, Snitch, Nice Guesser, Mayor, and Judge may become Madmate (Host settings). Skill changes when the following roles are converted into Madmates:<br>
Time Manager => Doing tasks will reduce meeting time.<br>
Bodyguard => Skill won't activate if the killer is an Impostor.<br>
Grenadier => Flash bomb will work on Crewmates and Neutrals instead of the Impostors.<br>
Sheriff => Can kill anyone, including Impostors (Host settings).<br>
Nice Guesser => Can guess Crewmates and Neutrals<br>
Psychic => All evil Neutrals and Crewmates' names with the ability to kill will be displayed in Red.<br>
Judge => Can judge anyone<br>
Pacifist => Their ability only works on Crewmates.
