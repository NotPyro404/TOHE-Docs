Impostors and Madmates see Narc as their teammate, but Narc themselves don't know who the Impostors and Madmates are. Narc appears as a Sheriff to Crewmates Note: Depending on the settings, Impostors may kill each other when Narc is in a game. If the respective option is disabled, Narc won't be able to use their kill button until the other Impostors die.
