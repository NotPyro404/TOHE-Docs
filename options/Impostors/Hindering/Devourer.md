As the Devourer, you use your Shapeshift to change the appearance of the target of the Shapeshift permanently. Additionally, when each player's appearance changes, you will have your Kill Cooldown reduced by a defined number of seconds. If the Devourer dies or gets voted out during a meeting, the player's appearance will change back to their normal appearance.<br>
