As the Anonymous, you can Shapeshift to force your target to report whoever you killed this round. If you killed nobody that round, the target will report their own dead body as if they had died. Note: This does not work on Lazy nor Lazy Guy, and this ability will work regardless of whether the body can normally be reported.
