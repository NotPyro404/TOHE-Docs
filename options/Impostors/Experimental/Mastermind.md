As the Mastermind, you can use your Kill button on a player once to manipulate them. The manipulation does nothing if the target doesn't have a Kill button. But if the target does have a Kill button, whoever you manipulate will be told after a delay that they got manipulated and must kill someone in a limited time to survive. If the time limit expires or a meeting gets called before killing someone, they die. Double click on someone to kill them normally.<br>
