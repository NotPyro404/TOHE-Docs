A New Philosophy

One day, while watching Discovery+, a bean with a passion for history stumbled upon a concept that would change his life: yin and yang. This ancient idea from Chinese philosophy described two opposing yet interconnected forces that perpetually interact. Intrigued by the notion of these elements balancing each other while also being in conflict, he spent days delving into the topic.

Impostor Selection

When the time came for impostor selection, the bean had a brilliant idea. He would choose two players, one representing yin and the other yang. The goal? To instigate a rivalry that would either lead them to self-destruct or eliminate each other.

Idea Number 1: Instigate Anger

â€œToo much work,â€ he thought, dismissing this option.

Idea Number 2: Deception

â€œLies always work,â€ he mused. â€œLying to yin and yang? Thatâ€™s a fantastic idea!â€

Game One

He selected the players. To the yin, he whispered, â€œThe yang wants to destroy you. He claims heâ€™s far superior. You need to eliminate him.â€

Then, to the yang, he said, â€œItâ€™s your destiny to take down the yin. Thereâ€™s no other way to prove yourself.â€

To both players, he added ominously, â€œThe blood on your hands is a mark of your choices. You can decide whose blood it will be.â€

As the beans squared off against each other, the bean who orchestrated this scheme watched with glee. â€œYes! This is working perfectly!â€ he exclaimed.

The Conclusion

In the end, both yin and yang fell to their own rivalry, unaware that they had been manipulated. The bean, now calling himself the YinYanger, reveled in his cleverness as he claimed victory.

This was the birth of the Egoist and the YinYanger. In the aftermath, the only trace left behind was a single symbolâ€”the Chinese yin yang imageâ€”marking the chaos that ensued.
