Chapter 1: Darkness

The crewmates were in a state of panic. The lights had gone out, and a shadowy figure darted through the darkness, leaving chaos in its wake. Blood spattered the walls, and the sense of impending doom hung heavily in the air.

Chapter 2: Flashback

â€œAh, what a great day!â€ thought the scientist, immersed in his research on nanoparticles. He envisioned a groundbreaking technology that would enhance agility and stealth. This invention was meant as a gift for the sheriff. With a stroke of genius, he created the Ninja Suit. This suit could mark a target and then render the wearer invisible for a brief moment. In an instant, the wearer could shift from one location to anotherâ€”one moment in Electrical, the next in Admin.

Chapter 3: Back to Reality

Back in the present, the crewmates were on edge, struggling to navigate the pitch-black environment. One crewmate, frustrated by a mischievous fellow flicking the wrong switches, suddenly heard a chilling SLASH. Panic set in as two crewmates whispered urgently to each other.

â€œWhere is he? Where is he?â€
â€œKeep your head down; heâ€™s aiming for the lights!â€
â€œHeâ€™s using the darkness to conceal his approach!â€

Another SLASH echoed through the airâ€”three kills in mere seconds. The remaining crewmates realized they were in grave danger.

Chapter 4: Sabotage Resolved

â€œFinally!â€ exclaimed one crewmate as he fixed the sabotage, just in time to spot the shadowy figure nearby. With only three crewmates left, they were at a disadvantage. The agile Ninja was a master of evasion. Believing he was safe, they ejected an innocent crewmate, thinking they had eliminated the threat.

But the Ninja had been in control the entire time. Once a brilliant scientist, he had succumbed to the temptation of his own creation. â€œWhy should I share this gift?â€ he thought. â€œItâ€™s mineâ€”only mine!â€

Conclusion

In the end, technology can be both a healer and a harbinger of chaos. The Ninja, once a scientist driven by innovation, now embraced his darker side, proving that brilliance can lead to ruin.

The End
