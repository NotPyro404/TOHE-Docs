When the Kill Cooldown is over, QuickShooter can use the ShapeShift button to store a bullet. After a successful kill, if QuickShooter still has bullets remaining, he will immediately consume one bullet to reset the kill cooldown to zero.<br>
Depending on the host's settings, QuickShooter's ability may be restricted by the ShapeShift cooldown.
