As the Hangman, during the Shapeshifting, you use a unique killing method-strangling. This method ignores any status of the target, such as the shield of the Medic, the Bodyguard's protection, the Super Star's skills, etc. The strangled player will not leave a dead body, nor will it trigger any of its skills. For example, Veteran kill back (including additional roles), and Seer will not be prompted.<br>
