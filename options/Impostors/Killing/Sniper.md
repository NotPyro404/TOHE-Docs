You can shoot players from far away. You have to Shapeshift twice to make a successful snipe. Imagine an arrow pointing from your first Shapeshift location towards your Unshift location. That will be the direction in which the snipe will be made. The snipe kills the first person in its path. You cannot kill people normally until you use up all of your ammo.<br>
