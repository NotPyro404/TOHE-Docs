The Evil Guesser can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting. If correct, the target dies. If wrong, the Evil Guesser dies. The guessing command is: /bt [player id] [role]<br>
You can see the player's id before the player's name or use the /id command to view the id of all players.<br>
