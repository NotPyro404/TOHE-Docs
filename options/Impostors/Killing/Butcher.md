The Butcher's kills, including passive ones, leave multiple dead bodies on targets, which can be a bit confusing when reporting. Here's the rule: the killed target must repeatedly display the animation of being killed, which cannot be skipped, and they cannot participate in the meeting normally during this period. And if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will revenge everyone in anger.<br>
