Hereâ€™s a refined version of your story that adheres to guidelines and enhances clarity:

A New Assignment

One day, after losing a bet to the Ludopath, The Arrogance and The Bomber found themselves assigned to clean the lab for a week. â€œAnd of course, the evil cloning machine is in there,â€ Arro grumbled.

â€œHonestly, this is your fault!â€ The Arrogance shot back.

â€œHow was I supposed to know someone could eat that many pizzas in one bite?â€ The Bomber retorted, feigning innocence. â€œWell, excuse me for trying to get out of chores!â€

Arro paused. â€œIsnâ€™t that the evil cloning machine they were using?â€

â€œOh yeah! I was in that once,â€ The Bomber recalled, grinning. â€œIt tasted funny. You should give it a try; itâ€™ll be fun!â€

â€œHmmmâ€¦ they do say curiosity killed the cat,â€ Arro mused. With a mix of excitement and hesitation, he stepped inside the machine.

A Surprising Outcome

Moments later, he emerged from the other side, transformed.

â€œWhoa! Itâ€™s literally you, butâ€¦ more nerdy!â€ The Bomber exclaimed, barely containing his laughter.

â€œLetâ€™s show it to the boss,â€ Arro suggested, intrigued by the potential.

An Unexpected Mission

The Mind, curious about this new development, decided to send The Arrogance and the newly acquired Bard on a mission. It started smoothly until a meeting was called, and an innocent bean was ejected. Instead of the usual role reveal, musical notes appeared on the screen: â€œâ™ª â™ª â™ªâ€

The Arrogance observed this bizarre occurrence, realizing it kept happening.

â€œHmm, interesting,â€ he thought.

Experiment No. 2

It became clear that the Bard could kill like any impostor, but something unique occurred when a player was ejected while the Bard was still alive: random musical notes would display instead of revealing roles. Moreover, after each ejection, the Bardâ€™s cooldown was halved.

â€œThis is definitely something special,â€ The Arrogance concluded. Thus, he became known as The Bardâ€”a unique force within the game.
