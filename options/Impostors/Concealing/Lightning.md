As the Lightning, you cannot kill normally. Instead, your Kill button quantizes targets, which activates after a delay, causing the next person they encounter to kill them. Those who are actively quantized show a「■」next to their name. Additionally, those who have been quantized die if they survive until the end of a meeting. There is a setting to quantize your killer.
