As Rift Maker, you can Shapeshift to create a rift. You can teleport from one rift to another by touching the area where the rift was created. Trying to vent will kick you out, therefore destroying all the rifts. Note: Up to two rifts can be placed at a time; if you try to place a third, it removes the first one.
