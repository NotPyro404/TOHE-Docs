As the Phantom, you can press your Vanish button to go invisible to escape a kill. You can click your Appear button if you want to become visible before the timer runs out or not. Note: You will make a smoke cloud whenever you go invisible and become visible. So make sure you are in a safe area where no one will see you.<br>
