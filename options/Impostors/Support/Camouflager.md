When the Camouflager uses Shapeshift, all players start to look the same. This state ends when the Camouflager reverts its Shapeshifting. It's important to note that the skills of Communication Sabotage Camouflage, and the skills of the Camouflager can be superimposed. This skill will be invalid if a meeting is held during the skill activation of the Camouflager.<br>
