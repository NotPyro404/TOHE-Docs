As the Fireworker, you can Shapeshift to place Fireworks up to the maximum amount the Host sets. When you are the last Impostor and all Fireworks have been placed, Shapeshift again to detonate them and kill everyone in their radius, including you. If you kill all players with your Fireworks, it's considered an Impostor victory.<br>
