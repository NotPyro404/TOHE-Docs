The Gangster, a powerful character, can try to recruit a player to a Madmate by pressing the Kill button. If the recruitment is successful, both the Gangster and the target will see the Shield Animation on each other as a reminder (only visible to each other). The remaining number of available recruits is displayed next to the Gangster's name (the Host sets the maximum). If the Gangster tries to recruit players who cannot be recruited, such as Neutrals or some special Crewmates, they will kill the target normally instead. When the Gangster has no remaining recruitments, they can only make normal kills from that point on.
