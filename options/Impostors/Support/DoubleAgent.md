As the Double Agent, you cannot access the Kill button. However, you can vote for someone in a meeting to pass a bomb onto them, which can only be done one player at a time. Once the meeting has finished, the bomb will activate and explode in a set amount of time.<br>
Note: when you pass the bomb onto someone in a meeting, you can vote afterward.<br>
Additionally depending on settings the Double Agent can diffuse Bastion and Agitator bombs when Venting. The Double Agent can change roles when they are the Last Impostor, depending on the settings the role can be a Admired Impostor, Trickster, Traitor, or stay as the Double Agent.
