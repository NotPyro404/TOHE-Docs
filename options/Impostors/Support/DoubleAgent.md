As the Double Agent, you do not have access to the kill button, but you can vote someone in a meeting to pass a bomb onto them. This can only be done one player at a time. Once the meeting has finished the bomb will activate and explode in a set amount of time.
Note that when you pass the bomb onto someone in a meeting you will be able to vote afterwards.
Additionally depending on settings the Double Agent can diffuse Bastion and Agitator bombs when venting.

Prologue Hecate is known for herâ€¦ double sidedness and.. ability to join forces with the group who is about to win the battleâ€¦ Just like his mentor the Double agent would do something quiteâ€¦ Simmilar Chapter 1 GO RED! Nvm GO BLUE! Even in school while placing bets the Double agent would alwaysâ€¦ Cheat altering his bets mid game and what could others do about it.. Not like theres a written contract While in sports one day the Double agent literally changed teamsâ€¦ MID GAME.. Crazy guy.. Chapter 2 Hecate? â€œI am so Proud of youâ€¦ As Hecate was engulfed by a green flameâ€ That wasâ€¦ Out of the blueâ€¦ But this gave a new foundâ€¦ Purpose? Now rather than slacking off he would try toâ€¦ do something with his life Chapter 3 Trusty Newspaper â€œSince our newest Impostor has died very soon we are looking for new Impostorsâ€ Interesting thought the Double agentâ€¦ Can â€˜Iâ€™ Enter? Let me see if I may even become an Impostor Chapter 4 Hello and you are? The mad mate scientist was the first one to greet him andâ€¦ He introduced so many new things to the double agent who was keen on killing butâ€¦ Winning And the main thing that spiked his curiosity was the meeting bomber shooterâ€¦ He could pass a bomb to the person he threw it on and they would have no ideaâ€¦ Chapter 5 So.. What now? The neutral killers are dead.. The crew found the Double agents partner and still.. 5 More crewmates leftâ€¦ There was several possibilities how he could winâ€¦ Camouflaging as a crewmate by tricking themâ€¦ Trickster sounds good.. Admiredâ€¦ Instant win but he would betray his original team butâ€¦ Win! Traitor.. He would leave both teams and work on his own.. And.. He chose to convince himself and admire HIMSELF how narcissisticâ€¦ But.. He won in any case! And Hecate wasâ€¦ SO proud that she gave him a godly giftâ€¦ He could now see roles.. But since the double agent was admired he took on a life of no killing but He would steal wins.. The End
