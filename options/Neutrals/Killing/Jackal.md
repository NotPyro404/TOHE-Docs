As the Jackal, you win if you are the last player alive. Additionally, you may recruit using the Kill button. If the target is not one you can recruit, you have run out of uses, or you don't have the option to recruit, then you will kill people normally (i.e., don't use Kill buttons in front of others thinking it'll recruit). If the target has a Kill button and the option to turn into a Sidekick is on, they will become a Sidekick. Otherwise, they will gain the Recruit Add-on if the option to give the Recruit Add-on is on.<br>
Depending on the settings, when Jackal was killed, a Sidekick will be randomly selected as the new Jackal.<br>
Recruit may be selected if no Sidekick is alive.<br>
