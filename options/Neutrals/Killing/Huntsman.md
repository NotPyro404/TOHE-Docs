As the Huntsman, you are given a certain number of targets that reset every meeting. If you successfully eliminate one of your targets, your Kill Cooldown goes down permanently by the set amount. However, if you kill someone not one of your targets, your Kill Cooldown permanently increases by the set amount. A colored name indicates your targets.<br>
