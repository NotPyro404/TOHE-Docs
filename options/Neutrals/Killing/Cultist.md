As the Cultist, your Kill Button is used to Charm others, making them win with you. To win, charm all who pose a threat and gain the majority.<br>
Depending on settings, you may be able to charm Neutrals, and those you Charm may count as their original team, nothing, or a Cultist to determine when you win due to majority.
