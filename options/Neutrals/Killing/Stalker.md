The Stalker can kill anyone, and every kill will immediately cause a Lights Sabotage (if Lights Sabotage is already active, nothing will happen). Stalker cannot Vent. If the Impostor wins while the Stalker is alive or the Crewmate wins by killing the Impostors (according to the Host's setting, the Stalker may also win when the Crewmate wins by killing the Neutrals), then the Stalker wins alone.<br>
