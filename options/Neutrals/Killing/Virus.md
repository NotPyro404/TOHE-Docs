The task of the Virus is to kill or infect all other players. When the Virus murders a Crewmate, their corpse is infected with a virus. The Crewmate who reports this corpse is infected joins the virus team or dies at the end of the meeting if the Virus doesn't get voted out, depending on the settings.<br>
If more players are on the Virus team than the Crewmate team, the Virus team wins.
