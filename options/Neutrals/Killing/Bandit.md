As the Bandit, you can click your Kill button one time to steal a player's Add-on and twice to kill. Depending on the settings, you may instantly steal the Add-on or after the meeting starts. After the maximum number of steals is reached, you will kill normally. Additionally, if there are no stealable Add-ons on the target or the target is Stubborn, you will kill the target.<br>
Kill everyone to win.<br>
Note: Cleansed, Last Impostor, and Lovers cannot be stolen.<br>
Note: If Bandit can Vent is on, Nimble will become unstealable.
