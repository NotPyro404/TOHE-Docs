As the Glitch, you can hack players (single click) or kill normally (double click).<br>
Those who have been hacked cannot kill, Vent, or report for the hack duration.<br>
Additionally, calling a Sabotage other than doors will have no effect and will instead disguise you as a random player. You cannot disguise during or after Sabotages.<br>
To win, be the last player alive.
