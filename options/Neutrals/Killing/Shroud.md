As the Shroud, you do not kill normally.
Instead, use your Kill button to shroud a player.<br>
Shrouded players kill others.
If the shrouded player doesn't make a kill, they'll kill themselves after a meeting.<br>
Shroud sees shrouded players with a ã€Œâ—ˆã€mark next to their name.
Shrouded players who did not make a kill will also have the ã€Œâ—ˆã€mark in meetings, where they'll die if the Shroud is alive by the end of the meeting.<br>
