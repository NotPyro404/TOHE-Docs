As the Berserker, you level up with each kill.<br>
Upon reaching a certain level defined by the Host, you unlock a new power.<br>
Scavenged kills make your kills disappear.
Bombed kills make your kills explode. Be careful when killing, as this can kill your other Apocalypse members if they are near.<br>
After a certain level, you become War.<br>
