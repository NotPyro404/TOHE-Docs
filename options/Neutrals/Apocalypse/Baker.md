# <font color=#8c7458>ðŸž <b>Baker</b></font> <Badge text="Apocalypse" type="tip" vertical="middle"/>

As the Baker, you can use your Kill Button on a player per round to give them bread. Depending on settings, if a player with Bread dies, then you can give bread again in that same round.<br>
Once a set amount of players are alive with bread, you become Famine.<br>
If the Bread gives additional effects and the setting is on, then you can Vent to change the bread that you give out. <br>
<b>Bread Effects:</b><br>
Reveal: Reveals the target's role to the Baker (stays the whole game)<br>
Roleblock: Resets the target's Kill Cooldown when they try to use their Kill Button<br>
Barrier: Gives the target a Barrier that is only known to the Baker (Barrier is removed after the meeting)<br>
