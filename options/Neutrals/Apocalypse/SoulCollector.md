As Soul Collector, you can use your Kill button on a player to predict their death. You will gain a Soul if your target dies in the round you select them or the meeting after.<br>
Your target resets after each meeting or after they die, whichever comes first. <br>
Once you collect the configurable amount of Souls, you become Death.<br>
If the gain passive Souls setting is enabled, you will gain a Soul each meeting.<br>
