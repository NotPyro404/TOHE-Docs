As the Shaman, you can use your Kill button to select a Voodoo Doll once per round. If the Kill button is used on you, the effect will be deflected onto the Voodoo Doll.
If you survive until the end, you win with the winning team.<br>
Note: If the killer cannot kill the chosen target, murder is canceled, but if the killer rechecks the Shaman, the killer will kill the Shaman.
