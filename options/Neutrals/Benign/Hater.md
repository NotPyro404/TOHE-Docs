As the Hater, you have no Kill Cooldown.<br>
However, depending on the settings, you can only kill Lovers and other Recruiting Roles and Add-ons. Killing anyone else will make you suicide. You win at the end of the game with the winning team if none of the killable roles are alive. <br>
You will not be Lovers.
