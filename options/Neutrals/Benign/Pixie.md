As the Pixie, mark up to an X amount of targets each round by using the Kill button on them. You must have one of the marked targets ejected when the meeting starts. If unsuccessful, you will commit suicide, except if you didn't mark any targets or all the targets are dead. The selected targets reset to 0 after the meeting ends. If you succeed, you will gain a point. You see all your targets in colored names.<br>
You win with the winning team when you have certain amounts of points set by the Host.
