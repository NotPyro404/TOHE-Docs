The Doomsayer can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting.<br>
If the Doomsayer guesses a certain number of roles (the number depends on the Host settings), then he wins.<br>
The guessing command is: /bt [player id] [role]<br>
You can see the player's id before the player's name, or use the /id command to view the id of all players.<br>
