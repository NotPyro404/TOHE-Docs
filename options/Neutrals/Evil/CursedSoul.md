As the morning's rosy cheeked son, Dawn rose, Menalaus got up from his bed 
Ready to face whatever came his way.
"Morning chap" said he.
Going to work was always a journey. 
He arrived to Mira HQ and slopped down to his chair.
"Already tired" Came a known voice from behind
"No sir, No!"
"Good"
Thinking about this interaction Menalaus got extremely gloomy..
Very well be cursed with a bad job by now..
Jove was not happy at all about this 
"Kid think before saying"
As he zapped him of his soul.
A few moments later...
"I feel awfully weird now"
"Must be your stomach" said the Master mind.
"Maybe"
And as the day progressed this only got **Worse**
He started to feel melancholy
Like something was missing..
By jove! He got it.. 
It was not common but.. he was cursed.
He needed to perform a sacrifice.. Until it isn't fulfilled He would need to face the wrath of the gods.
A soul for a soul.. or more depending on the anger level of the god.
"Dear Mr. Nestor
You may know that I am a very ambitious fellow like you
Now tell me true and tell me truly 
To what extend would you go on if I could Guarantee you the win?"
"Dear Mr. Menalaus
Well my good sir I would even sell my soul for it!"
Perfect.
And as the ages went on the harpy's sang and Cyclops screeched but Menalaus was on an agenda
An agenda to get his soul back
What was the best way of taking souls he pondered.
Well... Snatching them is out of the question
Or... Was it?
Everything is Legal in Mira.
Let's go.
But he needed **Help**
Help from his trust alliance partner..
Ulysseus.
Now Ulysseus was a man of great wonders.
Skinny, tall, good looking I might add
Ulysseus possessed knowledge about witchcraft More than anyone could imagine
Even circe tipped her hat to him in awe and respect..
Now that he had it all prepared he could strike..
He went around hopping in joy as he felt some part of his soul get re-absorbed back into his Skinny body
He had gone pale with fear but now he was his old self Pink cheeked and joyful
Now the blonde Ulysseus went hither-tither with enjoyment when he saw his product work better than he could imagine
Jumping around as Jove granted them their soul's back 
And granted them the win..
Tell me Oh great prophet
One who knows all
One who sees all
Will this be a happy ending for our protagonists? 
"I will tell you true and tell you truly"
"It will indeed be a joyous occasion for our heroes"
The one who faced the challenge
The one who faced Many woes
And the ones who trusted them
