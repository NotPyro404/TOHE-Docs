The Arsonist can douse by clicking the kill button on the player and following them for a few seconds. When the dousing starts and it's successful, a shield animation will be displayed as a reminder (only visible to themselves). When the Arsonist has doused all surviving players, the Arsonist can vent to start the fire and win alone.

If the player name shows ã€Œâ–³ã€, that means they are being doused;
if the player name shows ã€Œâ–²ã€, it means they have been completely doused.
Depending on the setting, Arsonist may start the fire anytime. But if he failed to kill everyone, he loses.
