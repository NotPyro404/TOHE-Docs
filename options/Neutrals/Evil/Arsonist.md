The Arsonist can douse a player by clicking the Kill button on the player and following them for a few seconds. When the dousing starts and it's successful, a Shield Animation will happen as a reminder (only visible to themselves). When the Arsonist has doused all surviving players, the Arsonist can Vent to start the fire and win alone.<br>
If the player name shows ã€Œâ–³ã€, that means they are being doused;<br>
If the player name shows ã€Œâ–²ã€, it means they have been completely doused.
Depending on the setting, Arsonist may start the fire anytime. But if he fails to kill everyone, he loses.<br>
