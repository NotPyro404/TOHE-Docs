As the Vulture, report bodies to win!<br>
When you report a body, if your Eat Cooldown is up, you'll eat the body (makes it unreportable).<br>
If your eat ability is still on Cooldown, then you'll report the body normally.<br>
Additionally, you'll report bodies normally if the maximum bodies eaten per round is reached.<br>
