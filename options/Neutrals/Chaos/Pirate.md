As the Pirate, use your Kill button to select a target every round.<br>
You will duel with your target in the next meeting. <br>
If both the Pirate and the target choose the same number, the Pirate wins.<br>
Additionally, if the Pirate wins the duel or the target doesn't participate in the duel, the Pirate kills the target.<br>
Dueling command: /duel X (where X can be 0, 1, or 2)<br>
You win after winning a certain number of duels set by the Host.<br>
Note: The kill would not count towards Pirate victory if the target did not participate in the duel.<br>
