As the Revolutionist, you can recruit players by clicking the Kill button on the player and following them until the Shield Animation plays for you. Recruiting has a chance, set by the Host, to kill players (though they are still recruited). When the required number of players are recruited (displayed next to your name), you must Vent within the specified time to win the game immediately with all your recruits. If you do not Vent in time, you lose and die.<br>
