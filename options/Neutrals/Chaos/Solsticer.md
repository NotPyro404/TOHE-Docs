As the Solsticer, you won't die, and you win by finishing all your tasks in a single round. After every meeting finishes, your tasks reset, and you need to start all over again.<br>
Votes on the Solsticer will be directly canceled.<br>
Kill attempts on the Solsticer will teleport it out of the map like Pelican until the meeting is finished.<br>
The killer's Kill Cooldown will be reset to 10 seconds.<br>
Solsticer is counted as nothing in-game.
