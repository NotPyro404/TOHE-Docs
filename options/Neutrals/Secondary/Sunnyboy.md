The Sunnyboy can check the life status of others through the life panel. When the Sunnyboy is alive, the game will not end due to a numerical advantage, (for example, the number of <font color=red>Impostors</font> is greater than the number of Crewmates, or there are no survivors). If the Sunnyboy dies at the end of the game, the Sunnyboy will win with the winning team
* You must have â€œDisable Hidden Rolesâ€ toggled <font color=red>OFF</font> for this to have a chance to appear
* Despite being listed under Evil, this role is actually Benign. It is only listed as Evil due to Jester being an Evil role.
