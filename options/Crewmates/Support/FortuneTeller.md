As the Fortune Teller, vote for a player in a meeting to get a clue to their role.<br>
The clue will relate to their actual role.<br>
When the Fortune Teller's tasks are complete, they will obtain the exact role rather than a clue!<br>
Note: If the setting to give random active players as a hint is on, you cannot check the same player multiple times.
