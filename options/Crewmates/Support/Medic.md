The Medic can place a shield on the target by pressing the Kill button. The Medic can only give one shield for the whole game. Depending on the settings, the target's shield can or cannot deactivate when the Medic dies. The Medic can also see if someone is trying to break the target's shield.<br>
Depending on the Host's settings, the Medic or the target can see if the player has a shield (shown as a green circle ã€Œâœšã€ next to the name).
