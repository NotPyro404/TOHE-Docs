As an Investigator, you can use your Kill button to investigate someone. When you investigate someone, their name will appear in red if they possess a Kill button (Impostor/Shapeshifter basis) or light blue if they lack a Kill button (Crewmate/Engineer/Scientist basis). However, please note that the color of the names will return to normal when someone calls a meeting.
