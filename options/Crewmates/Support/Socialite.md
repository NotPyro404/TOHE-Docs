The Socialite may use their kill button on a player to "throw a party" on that player for the round. Anyone who attempts to interact with the partied player will be denied that round and will be notified that there was a party on that player. These rejected players will be added to a "Guest List", which the Socialite will be notified of during the next meeting. Everyone on the Guest List will now be able to interact with any player the Socialite parties with. The Socialite may also vote a player during a meeting to add that player to the Guest List. Players can not be removed from the Guest List.
