As a merchant, you sell a random Add-on to a random player for each task you complete. Each Add-on sold earns you money. If you have a certain amount of money, you can prevent the next killing attempt against you by bribing the murderer. The bribed player won't be able to kill you, but you don't know who it is. The money used is lost and not available for additional bribes.
