The Medium can establish contact with a dead player after someone reports a dead body. The player who reports doesn't have to be the Medium. The dead player can answer once with a YES or a NO to the Medium's question, which only the Medium will see (the dead player can use /ms yes or /ms no). Note: Medium won't be Oblivious.
