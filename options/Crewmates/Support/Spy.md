As the Spy, when someone uses their Kill button on you (any ability used through the Kill button), you'll see their name in orange for a few seconds.<br>
Note: If a Crewmate used their ability on you, you'll also see them with an orange name!<br>
Note: If you cannot use left, you won't see orange names!<br>
Note: If the Kill button interaction is blocked, the player's Cooldown will reset to 10s.
