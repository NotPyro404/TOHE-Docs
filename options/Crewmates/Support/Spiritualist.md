As the Spiritualist, you get an arrow pointing towards the ghost of the last meeting's victim. There is an option for the arrow to disappear and reappear in intervals. Try to notify the ghost about your ability if you can; if they are on your side, they may lead you to an evil role so you can eject them. Be careful, as evil roles can do the same for Crewmates.
