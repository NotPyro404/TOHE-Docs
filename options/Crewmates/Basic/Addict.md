As the Addict, you have a suicide timer. When it expires, you kill yourself.<br>
The timer is indicated by the Vent Cooldown. When the Vent Cooldown is 0 seconds, you still have a short time to Vent.<br>
If you don't make it, you die; if you make it, the Suicide Timer is reset.<br>
Also after you Vent, no one can interact with you for a defined period.<br>
After; the period is over, and you are immobilized for another defined period, and cannot Report any bodies.
