As the Task Manager your objective is to help the crew finish tasks as fast as possible.<br>
Everytime you complete a task one random crewmate will have one of their tasks completed.<br>
You will be rewarded with a random add-on if any crewmate finishes all their tasks.
Any tasks completed will affect you if marked by other roles.<br>
Depending on settings you might get information on what visual tasks were completed in past rounds.
