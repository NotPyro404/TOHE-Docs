As The Overseer, you have minimal vision, but you can use your Kill button to reveal the role of a nearby player. A ã€Œâ—‹ã€ will be displayed next to the revealed target after you use the Kill button on them, and you will also be scanning them (only you can see this). Stay near the target for a defined time to reveal his role; if you move too far away, the reveal will cancel.
