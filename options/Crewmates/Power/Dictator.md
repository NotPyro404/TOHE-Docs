When the Dictator votes for someone, the meeting will end on the spot, and the player they voted for will be ejected from the meeting. The moment the Dictator votes someone out, the Dictator will also die.
If the setting to use the command is on, the Dictator will have to use '/exp id' in order to exile someone. The Dictator will be able to vote normally.
