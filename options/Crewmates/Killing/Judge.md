The Judge can judge a certain player during the meeting. If the target is evil, the target will be killed (whether it is evil or not is set by the Host). If it is wrong, the Judge commits suicide.<br>
Command for judgment: /tl [player id]<br>
You can see the player's id before the player's name, or use the /id command to view the id of all players.<br>
Judges can judge all players when they become Madmate.<br>
