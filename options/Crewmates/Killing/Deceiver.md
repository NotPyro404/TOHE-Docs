The Deceiver can sell the counterfeit to other players through the Kill button. If the counterfeit is sold successfully, the Deceiver will see a Shield Animation on their body as a reminder. The counterfeit will take effect after the end of the next meeting. If the player with no kill ability holds the counterfeit, he will kill himself immediately. If the player with the killing ability has the counterfeit, he will commit suicide when he tries to kill someone next time.
