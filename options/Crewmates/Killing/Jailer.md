As the Jailer, use your Kill button to lock a player in jail. During the next meeting, the jailed player cannot vote or get voted (the vote count will be 0). The Jailer may choose to execute the prisoner by voting for them. If the Jailer executes an innocent player, the Jailer loses the ability to execute for the rest of the game.
If the Jailer is evil, then they can execute anyone.<br>
The Jailer has limited executions.<br>
Note: Jailed players cannot be guessed or judged, and jailed players can only guess Jailer.
