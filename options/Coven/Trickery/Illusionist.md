The Illusionist can use their Kill button on a player to reverse the results of any investigative role. For example, if someone with a Kill button is Illusioned, they will appear not to have a Kill button to the Investigator, and vice versa.
Illusions wear off after meetings.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, you may additionally double-click to kill. Every kill you make appears as a random death reason.</b>
