The Hex Master can use their Kill button to mark a player with the ä¹‚ symbol. If a player has this at the end of the meeting and the Hex Master hasn't died - then they die.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, the Hex will be passed around - similar to an Agitator bomb. Also, you can additionally double-click the Kill button to kill normally.</b>
