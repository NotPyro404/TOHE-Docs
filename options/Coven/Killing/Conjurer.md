Shapeshift once to mark a location.
Shapeshift again to conjure a meteor at the place you marked, killing everyone in the radius.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, you can additionally kill. You can also mark a player using the Shapeshift UI. When the Conjurer clicks the Shapeshift button again, all the players in the radius of the marked player will die, including the marked player.</b>
