During a meeting, the Ritualist can perform a Blood Ritual to guess a playerâ€™s exact role. If the Ritualist is correct, that player will be converted to Coven. If the Ritualist is incorrect, they will not die but will be unable to Blood Ritual until the next meeting.<br>
The command is /rt id role.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, the Ritualist can additionally kill.</b>
