The Coven Leader can use their Kill button on a fellow Coven member to retrain them into a random Coven role that isnâ€™t currently in the game. During the next meeting, that Coven member will be notified that the Coven Leader wishes to retrain them. They can vote themselves to accept the retrain, or vote otherwise to deny it. Denying the retrain does not take away an ability usage.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, you gain access to the kill button and you are able to retrain anyone who is helping Coven (eg. Lawyer or Medic who has shielded Coven). You are also immune to being recruited.</b>
