As the Necromancer, you can Shapeshift to become the role of a random dead person for a set duration.<br>
Some roles can not be used.<br>
Once a role is used, it can not be used the rest of the game.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, you can additionally kill. If you use shapeshift to become another role, the Necronomicon will be given to another Coven member, but will be returned back to you when you change back to Necromancer. While being Necromancer, when someone tries to kill you, you will block the kill and be teleported to a random Vent. You have a limited time to kill your killer. If the time runs out or you try to kill someone else, you die.<br>
This does not work if you are a different role.</b>
