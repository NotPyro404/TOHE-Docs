The Voodoo Master can craft a Voodoo Doll of a player by using their Kill button, similar to the Shaman. All the interactions with you using Kill button will be deflected to the Voodoo Doll and the Voodoo Doll will destroy. Unlike the Shaman, this voodoo will last during the meeting (eg. If the Voodoo Master is judged, then the voodoo'd player will be judged instead).<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, you can additionally double-click to kill. Additionally, the voodooâ€™d player will be unable to report. The next person to interact with them will die.</b>
