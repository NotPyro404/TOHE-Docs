The Medusa can use their Kill button on players to mark them as Stoned. When the Medusa clicks the Shapeshift button, all Stoned players will be unable to move and will have reduced vision for a configurable amount of time.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, you can additionally double-click the kill button to kill normally. Killed players will be unreportable.</b>
