The Sacrifist can Shapeshift to cause a random debuff to a non-Coven member, however, the Sacrifist will also receive this effect (when applicable).<br>
The random player will be the same player until the round ends.<br>
Depending on the Hostâ€™s settings, if the Sacrifist is voted out, some random non-Coven who voted the Sacrifist will die too.<br>
Normally, the Sacrifist can not kill, however, to prevent prolonging of the game, Sacrifist can kill if they are the last Coven member alive.<br>
<b>With the Necronomicon, when you Shapeshift, you will commit the Ultimate Sacrifice. When you do this, you die. However, the entire Coven for the rest of the game receives a lowered Kill Cooldown.</b>
